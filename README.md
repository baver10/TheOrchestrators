# TheOrchestrators
Contains all agents of Agentic AI solution to implement use case D2 of Google Cloud Agentic AI Hackathon 2025.

Use Case Details:
- **Use Case Name**: [D2] - Sustainability Optimization for Manufacturing and Retail
- **Use Case Description**: Retailers and manufacturers face growing pressure to meet aggressive sustainability goals while operating cost-effectively. Real-time visibility into carbon impact, supplier sustainability performance, and waste across facilities and logistics is fragmented or missing altogether. Manual reporting is slow, error-prone, and reactive. This use case proposes an intelligent, multi-agent system that proactively monitors, evaluates, and optimizes sustainability across the enterprise value chain. From sourcing and operations to logistics and compliance, AI agents collaborate to reduce emissions, improve efficiency, and strengthen ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) postureâ€”all while keeping business performance intact.

    **Parameters**:

  - **Carbon Footprint Tracking Agent**: Integrates data from suppliers, transport, energy systems, and store operations.
  - **Smart Waste & Inventory Agent**: Forecasts perishable spoilage and waste based on sales velocity and expiry dates.
  - **Energy Optimization Agent**: Interfaces with IoT sensors across warehouses and stores.
  - **Sustainable Procurement Agent**: Continuously scores suppliers on emissions, labor ethics, and material sustainability.
  - **Compliance & ESG Reporting Agent**: Automates data collection for ESG reports and regulatory filings.
  - **Orchestration Agent**: Coordinates tradeoffs across emissions, cost, lead time, and compliance.
